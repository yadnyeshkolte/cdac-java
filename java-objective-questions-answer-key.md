# Java Objective Questions Answer Key

## 1. What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (methods). The four main principles of OOP are:
- **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to certain components of an object.
- **Inheritance**: Mechanism to create a new class using the properties and methods of an existing class.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.

## 2. What is the purpose of a constructor in Java?
A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the new object. There are two types of constructors:
- **Default Constructor**: No parameters.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts parameters to initialize an object with specific values.

## 3. What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data. Access modifiers (public, private, protected) are used to achieve encapsulation.

## 4. What is inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class derives properties and methods from an existing class. The existing class is called the parent (or superclass), and the new class is called the child (or subclass). Types of inheritance include:
- **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from one class.
- **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class can inherit from a class that is also a subclass of another class.
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.

## 5. What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. There are two types:
- **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: Same method name with different parameters.
- **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

## 6. What are access modifiers?
Access modifiers are keywords that set the accessibility (visibility) of classes, methods, and other members. The main access modifiers are:
- **Public**: Accessible from any other class.
- **Private**: Accessible only within its own class.
- **Protected**: Accessible within its own package and by subclasses.
- **Default** (no modifier): Accessible only within its own package.

## 7. What are static members in Java?
Static members belong to the class rather than any instance of the class. They are shared among all instances. Static variables are initialized only once at the start of the execution, and static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.

## 8. Explain the 'this' keyword in Java.
The 'this' keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It is used to differentiate between class attributes and parameters in constructors or methods.

## 9. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
- **Abstract Class**: Can have both abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with body). It can have member variables and constructors.
- **Interface**: Can only have abstract methods (until Java 8) and static final variables. It cannot have any concrete methods prior to Java 8.

## 10. What is method overloading?
Method overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different type or number of parameters). It allows methods to perform similar functions with different inputs.
