2. Retrieve a book by its ID using get().  
3. Check if a given Book ID exists using containsKey().  
4. Check if a particular Book object exists using containsValue().  
5. Display the total number of books using size().  
6. Iterate through all entries using entrySet(), keySet(), and values().  
7. Update book details (like price) using replace().  
8. Remove a book by ID using remove().  
9. Clear all books using clear().  
10. Verify if the collection is empty using isEmpty().
