**Q1. Answer: b) A class can exist without creating any object.**
- Classes are templates/blueprints and can exist independently of objects.

**Q2. Answer: a) Raj 20**
- The constructor properly initializes the fields and prints them.

**Q3. Answer: b) this**
- `this()` is used to call another constructor in the same class.

**Q4. Answer: a) 50 20**
- `x` is static (shared among all instances), `y` is instance-specific.

**Q5. Answer: a) Belong to the class, not objects.**
- Static members are class-level, not instance-level.

**Q6. Answer: a) null**
- Array elements are initialized to null for reference types.

**Q7. Answer: a) private variables + public methods**
- Encapsulation hides data using private and provides controlled access via public methods.

**Q8. Answer: b) Compilation error**
- Cannot access private member `data` from outside the class.

**Q9. Answer: c) Inheritance**
- Inheritance allows subclasses to acquire properties from superclass.

**Q10. Answer: b) Class B**
- Runtime polymorphism - the overridden method in B is called.

**Q11. Answer: a) Method overloading**
- Method overloading is resolved at compile-time.

**Q12. Answer: a) Drawing Circle**
- The concrete implementation in Circle class is called.

**Q13. Answer: a) The current object**
- `this` refers to the current instance.

**Q14. Answer: b) 100**
- Constructor parameter is assigned to instance variable using `this.x`.

**Q15. Answer: b) It cannot be inherited.**
- `final` classes cannot be extended/inherited.

**Q16. Answer: b) Compilation error**
- Cannot extend a final class.

**Q17. Answer: a) super**
- `super()` calls the parent class constructor.

**Q18. Answer: b) A constructor B constructor**
- Parent constructor is called first, then child constructor.

**Q19. Answer: d) default**
- Default (package-private) access allows access within the same package only.

**Q20. Answer: b) 100**
- `protected` member is accessible in subclass.

**Q21. Answer: c) Constructor**
- Constructors cannot be declared static.

**Q22. Answer: b) 2**
- Static variable `count` is incremented twice by two constructor calls.

**Q23. Answer: c) final methods can be overridden.**
- This is FALSE - final methods cannot be overridden.

**Q24. Answer: b) B**
- `super.display()` calls the parent class (B) method.

**Q25. Answer: b) final**
- `final` keyword prevents modification after initialization.

**Q26. Answer: b) Compilation error**
- Cannot modify a final variable after initialization.

**Q27. Answer: b) They cannot have return type.**
- Constructors don't have return types (not even void).

**Q28. Answer: c) Creates object successfully**
- Private constructor can be called from within the same class.

**Q29. Answer: b) Polymorphism**
- Polymorphism allows different implementations of the same method.

**Q30. Answer: c) Bark Meow**
- First `a` refers to Dog (prints "Bark"), then to Cat (prints "Meow").
